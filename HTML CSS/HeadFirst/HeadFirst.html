        access to the Internet, so bring your laptop. <br>
        Our guarantee: at the lounge, we're committed to providing you,
        our guest, with an exceptional experience every time <br> you visit.

      <p>
        But that's not all; at night, join us in the backroom as our resident
        DJ spins a choice selection of trance and drum&amp;bass beats across
        our spacious tiki-themed dance floor. Or just hang out in one of our
        comfy white vinyl booths at the dance bar. You can have your elixirs
        delivered from the main lounge right to the dance floor. If you've
        had enough of the beat, just head back to the lounge area to relax.
        And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll always be
        connected with our wireless Internet access.
